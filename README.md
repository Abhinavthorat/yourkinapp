# Kin: AI-Driven Cross-Chain Liquidity

A decentralized protocol for optimizing yield arbitrage across fragmented L2 networks using zero-knowledge proofs. Kin aggregates liquidity pools to minimize slippage for high-frequency algorithmic traders.

## Architecture

- **ZK-Rollup Aggregation**: Uses zk-SNARKs to batch transaction proofs for gas-efficient settlement.
- **Dynamic Yield Routing**: AI agents continuously monitor APY across Aave, Compound, and Curve to rebalance liquidity.
- **Non-Custodial Bridges**: Trustless asset bridging via atomic swaps.

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash

   ```

3. **Run Node:**
   ```bash
